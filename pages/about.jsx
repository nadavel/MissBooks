                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Miss Books began with a simple idea: to create a space where book lovers can discover, discuss, and fall in love with literature. Inspired by the charm of small, dusty bookstores, we wanted to build a community where every book has a story, and every reader feels at home. Whether you're looking for a classic to read by the fire or a thrilling new bestseller, we've got something for everyone.</p>
